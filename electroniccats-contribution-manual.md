# Contribution Manual

Please note that this project is released with a [**Community code of conduct**](https://github.com/ElectronicCats/electroniccats-cla/blob/main/electroniccats-community-code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms. 

We welcome your code contributions to this repository. Whether you're introducing a new feature, fixing a bug, or addressing any other issue, you can create a Pull Request to contribute. However, before doing so, please review the following points that we evaluate in your code and our expectations for Pull Requests.

First, identify the project to which you want to contribute. Check if there are any existing Pull Request related to the contribution you intend to make. If nobody is currently working on it, proceed to the following points to understand how you can structure the project and how we evaluate contributions.

See the instructions below for detailed instructions on how to do this via the GitHub web interface.
Keep in mind
[We](https://github.com/ElectronicCats) divide the contribution review into two processes. The first process aims to standardize the code and project structure, while the other focuses on the functionality and checks for coding style.
In the first step, we check if the Pull Request adheres to Conventional Commit Specifications to understand what you intend to add. The next part addresses the code; we use snake_case coding style. We acknowledge that certain cases may require different styling conventions, but we prefer consistency across most of the code.
Some check to know if your Pull Request will pass are:
Conventional Commits in the Pull Request (preferably, throughout the projectâ€™s commits)
snake_case in most of the code
Documented code, We verify whether your commit includes a README.md file that explains the functionality of your contribution. It should cover not only the basic functionality but also any intricate or notable features that require clarification.
## Instructions

You may want to first take a look at the requirements for admission into the Electronic Cats Github repository. Each submission will be checked for compliance before being accepted.

Click the following link:
https://github.com/ElectronicCats/project-name/fork
The "Create a new fork" page will open.

Click the Create fork button in the "Create a new fork" page.
A "Forking ElectronicCats/project-name/f" page will open while the fork is in the process of being created.

Wait for the "Forking" process to finish.
The home page of your fork of the library-registry repository will open.

You should see a banner on the page that says:

Click the "Contribute" link near the right side of that banner.
A menu will open.

Click the Open pull request button in the menu.
The "Open a pull request" page will open.

In the "Open a pull request" window that opens, click the Create pull request button.
The project will be automatically checked for compliance as soon as the pull request is submitted. If no problems were found, the pull request will be immediately merged and the project will be available for installation within a day's time.

If any problems are found, a bot or one of our collaborators will comment on the pull request to tell you what is wrong. The problem may be either with your pull request or with the project.

Doing this will update the pull request and cause the automated checks to run again.
